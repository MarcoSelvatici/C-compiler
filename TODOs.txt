Fix conditions for if, for and while, they can also be an assignment expression;
Proposed solution: parse the assignment expressions as Arithmetic and logic expressions 
and pass the register to the compileAssignmentExpression function.
(N.B this should also solve a = a = 3;)

Save the labels needed in a better way in "compiler_util.hpp". ATM is very messy

Switch statements need to compile the Test value each time before the case is entered 
(see SWITCH_TEST_CHANGING test)

Currently switch statements without a default statement are not allowed because the 
assembly breaks trying to branch at the beginning of the default at the end of
compileSwitchStatement()
